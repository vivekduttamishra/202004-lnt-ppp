Polymorphism

What?
* behaving in different ways depending on the input received <-- who? --> function


Why?
* Hide type/properties/methods
* features can be similar so we can specify them in base class?
* helps in abstraction---> you hide inner details

How?
* function and operator overloading
* method and overriding
* access modifier
